open cmd where you want to create a new project

npm create vite@latest
 give name of the project

select react from the list
then select javascript + SWC (+swc for faster bundling ) .you can also select only javascript .But +swc is better for faster bundling 

then go to the project folder and run->


npm install or npm i

cleanup project folder structure:
i.delete public , src/assets , src/App.css and src/index.css
ii. go to src/main.jsx and delete the line containing , "import './index.css'(4th line)
iii.go to src/App.jsx and remove all codes there.Then create a component called App with any text 
iv. then cmd-> npm run dev

 

notes on react js project:
app.jsx and main.jsx are the main components file
package.json -heart of the projects , contains all the dependencies that are needed to run the project




How react components works?
->React components are functions...(the first letter will be uppercase always)
->in any .jsx file you have to create individual components and then export them for UI to be rendered..(for ex- App.jsx component)
->These exported component will be imported in another file for the rendering process.( main.jsx will import this App.jsx and will render it in index.html root div)

This is called registering a component->
import React from 'react'
import Greet from './components/Greet';


export const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Greet/>
    </div>
  )
}
and this is called Exporting a component->
export default App ; 

and this is called importing a component->
import Greet from './components/Greet'


and this is called calling a component->

(ex- in the App.jsx file)
export const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Greet/>        //Here The Greet component is being called 
    </div>
  )
}



JSX RULES:
JSX must return a single parent element.
JSX elements must be properly closed.
js codes should be in {} braces.
JSX attributes are written using camelCase (e.g., className instead of class).




React shortcut:

'rafc' -> will create a boilerplate react arrow function component to any .jsx file

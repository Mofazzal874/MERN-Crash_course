<!-- JSX means javascript XML  -->


html is a markup language which provides the browser DOM elements to work with. 
react has its own DOM or Virtual DOM. for managing everything everyting in the browser, to compare the elements states before and 
after - react uses Javascript XML , which is similar to javascript objects. 

for example, if we want to create a button in react, we can write it like this:
react just make the elements in js objects like this ; 
for example : 
```jsx 
<h1 className= "Heading">
    <span className= "text">Hello World</span>
</h1>
```
it is similar to writing a javascript object like this:
```jsx
{
  type: 'h1',
  props: {
    className: 'Heading',
    children: {
      type: 'span',
      props: {
        className: 'text',
        children: 'Hello World'
      }
    }
  }
}
This JSX syntax is transformed into a JavaScript object that React can understand. Each JSX element corresponds to an object with a `type` and `props`, where `type` indicates the type of element (like 'h1' or 'span') and `props` contains the attributes and children of that element.
React components are built using this JSX syntax, which allows developers to write HTML-like code within Javascript. This makes it easier to visualize the structure of the UI and manage the components effectively.

When React renders a component, it creates a virtual representation of the DOM, which is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. This virtual DOM is used to determine what changes need to be made to the real DOM, optimizing performance by minimizing direct manipulations of the browser's DOM.

This structure allows React to efficiently update and render components by comparing the current state of the virtual DOM with the previous state.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
function MyButton() {
  return <button>Click me!</button>;
}
ReactDOM.render(<MyButton />, document.getElementById('root'));
```
In this example, we define a functional component `MyButton` that returns a JSX element representing a button. The `ReactDOM.render` method is then used to render this component into the DOM element with the ID 'root'.




Now about components
Components are the building blocks of a React application. They allow you to break down the UI into reusable pieces, making it easier to manage and maintain your code. Components can be either class-based or functional, with functional components being more common in modern React development.
A component can accept inputs, called "props," and return a React element that describes how a section of the UI should appear. Components can also manage their own state, allowing them to respond to user interactions and other events dynamically.
Components can be nested, meaning you can have components within components, creating a tree-like structure.

**NOTE:**
- we do not change the props of a component directly inside the component. Instead, we write the code in such a way that the component receives props when it is called. if we have to change the props inside , then we have to use state.

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
const element = <Welcome name="Sara" />;
root.render(element);
```



### React functional Components:
```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

- This function is a valid React component because it accepts a single “props” (which stands for properties) object argument with data and returns a React element. We call such components “function components” because they are literally JavaScript functions.

### React Class Components:
Class components are another way to define components in React, using ES6 classes. They can hold their own state and lifecycle methods, but with the introduction of hooks, functional components have become more prevalent.(we don't use class components very often now)

```jsx

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

class Clock extends React.Component{
    render(){
        return (
            <h1 className="heading">
                <span className="text">
                    {new Date().toLocaleTimeString(this.props.locals)}
                </span>
            </h1>
        );
    }
}

ReactDOM.render(<Clock locals="en-US" />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

- the locals prop is passed to the Clock component, which is then stored in the `props` object. The `render` method returns a React element that displays the current time formatted according to the specified locale.



Key Points:
- React only reacts when the state or props of a component change.
- Components can be defined as functions or classes.
- Functional components are simpler and more commonly used in modern React development.

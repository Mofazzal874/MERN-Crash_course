### What is state in React?
- state is data in a component that can change over time, usually in response to user actions or other events.
- state is managed within the component itself, allowing it to re-render when the state changes.
- state is mutable, meaning it can be updated, unlike props which are immutable.
- state is used to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
---
**NOTE:**
- `props` are not components own data , they are passed to the component from its parent.
- `state` is a component's own data that can change over time.
- React only reacts when the state or props of a component change.
- "state" is a built-in object that allows components to manage their own data and re-render when that data changes. so you can think of state as data storage for a component.
- But when the data in the `state` object changes, the components needs to be re-rendered.Thats the whole point of react. so react give us a function called `setState` to update the state of a component. when we call this function, react will re-render(call the render() function in the React.Component class) the component with the new state.

### Example of State in a React Component:
`Clock.js`
```jsx
import React from 'react';

class Clock extends React.Component{
    // constructor(props) { 
    //     super(props) ;  //calling the constructor of the parent
    //     this.state = {date: new Date()} ; 
    // }
    // or you can use a shortcut when you don't need the datas of props object
    state = {date: new Date()}
    componentDidMount(){  //componentDidMount() runs after component has been rendered to the DOM
        this.clockTimer = setInterval(()=> this.tick(), 1000) ; 
        
    }
    componentWillUnmount(){
        clearInterval(this.clockTimer) ; 
        

    }

    tick(){
        setInterval(()=> {
            this.setState({
                date: new Date() , //setting the date again after one second
            }) ; 
        }, 1000) ; //mounting or showing the re-rendered component every seconds so that it shows the the time every seconds and react will 
                    // react automatically after the date data changes
    }

    render(){
        return (
            <h1 className="heading">
                <span className="text">
                    {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString(this.props.locals)}
                </span>
            </h1>
        );
    }
}


export default Clock; 
```

```jsx
return (
    <div><Clock locals= "bn-BD"/></div>
  )
```
